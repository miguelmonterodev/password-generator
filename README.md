# Password Generator
**Password generator** application built in JavaScript.
We will generate a secured password combining 16 random characters (uppercase, lowercase, numbers and symbols).

We will add a copy-on-click to allow users copy and paste the generated password.  

There will be two passwords generated to choose one by the user.
